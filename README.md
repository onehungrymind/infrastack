# Welcome to infrastack ðŸ‘‹

This repo is meant to be an example of all the different facets of our DevOps approach. This repository will also help break out the different peices and help explain why and how everything works together.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to development are [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/),
[docker](https://www.docker.com/), and [kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/).
Kubernetes actually comes with Docker, and can be enabled through Docker preferences.

## Getting Started

Once all prerequisites are installed, run `make init` to download other necessary tools for development on MacOS.

If the AWS CLI has never been installed on your machine before,
make sure to [configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/getting-started-eksctl.html#configure-awscli) it.
